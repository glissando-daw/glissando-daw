## Music Sequencer

A music sequencer (or audio sequencer or simply sequencer) is a device or
application software that can record, edit, or play back music, by handling note
and performance information in several forms, typically CV/Gate, MIDI, or Open
Sound Control (OSC), and possibly audio and automation data for DAWs and
plug-ins.
